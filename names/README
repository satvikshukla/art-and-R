*** Downloading color names

Place lists of named colors in list/ in the format

r g b color_name

The names or r,g,b values do not need to be unique



*** Create single list of all names

./make.db

This will create color.names.txt in the format

r g b color_name

This is the list that will be used to generate the annotated named color file, which contains color space coordinates and list of neighbours.



*** Create annotated list of all names

This takes a while (5-10 minutes).

cat color.names.rgbonly.txt | ../bin/make.color.name.db > color.names.txt
